# Overview

This Python program uses the Folium mapping library to make multiple landmarkers in Idaho Falls, Idaho. So far, there are only two landmarker categories: hotels (in red) and attractions (in blue).

This program puts marks at the coordinates you specify and adds them onto a map and saves them as an HTML document.

# Development Environment

* Visual Studio Code

* Python 3.12
* Folium 0.18.0


# Useful Websites

* [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/latest) - Python library documentation
* [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps) - Used to find hotel and attraction coordinates

# Future Work

* Split the attraction markers into more categories
* Change icons on markers to be more accurate
* Add restaurant markers
